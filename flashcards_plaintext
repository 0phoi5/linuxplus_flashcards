Whether the resource is a file or directory. - denotes file, d denotes directory.

What is the name of the value that defines default permissions on a file or directory?
It’s umask

Can you set a umask that defines execute permissions should be set?
No. Because umask subtracts from the default permissions (666), it cannot force newly created files to set the execute bit.

What would a umask of 022 set on new, non-executable files? Why?
umask 022 would set the default permissions on new, non-executable files as 0644.
This is because the deafault is 0666, and the umask ‘takes away’ permissions, so (6-0),(6-2),(6-2) is 644.

What is SGID? What does it do?
Set Group ID. It’s a special permission for files and directories that allows users to run it as the group that owns the file.

How does SGID affect a directory?
All new files and subdirectories created within a directory with SGID set will inherit the SGID.
This does not apply to already existing objects, or files that are moved from elsewhere. They keep their permissions.

Using Symbolic mode, how do you set the SUID special permission on a file?

The ‘x’, within the relevant column in the file permissions (viewed via ls -l), will be an ‘s’ instead.

What does a sticky bit do?
It prevents anyone, other than the owner of a directory, from deleting files within that directory.
Without it, anyone with Write and Execute permissions can delete files in a directory.

Using Symbolic mode, how do you set a Sticky Bit on a file/directory?
chmod +t [DIR NAME]

How can you tell if a directory has a Sticky Bit assigned?
Listing the permissions via ls -l, you’ll see a ‘t’ on the end of them.

Using Absolute mode, how do you set the SGID special permission on a file/directory?
chmod 1### [DIR NAME]
